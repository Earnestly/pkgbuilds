WHY

  Most of these packages were created because the ones found in the AUR were
  not up to my standards. The majority of my packages are built from the latest
  developmental branches for both less maintenance burden, as package versions
  are programmatically generated, and for the newest fixes and bugs; hopefully
  fixes more so than bugs.  Primarily this eases working with upstream as any
  issues are reported against the latest code.

  The pkgdesc format is losely based on man-pages(7) such as using short
  lowercase, buzzword free descriptions similar to a manual's synopsis. Common
  variables are grouped together to improve PKGBUILD readability.

  I avoid abstractions at all costs unless it provides legitimate convenience.

DEVIATIONS FROM ARCH LINUX

  While Arch Linux provides mostly complete packages I don't split packages
  into multiple variations.  E.g. Instead of six pulseaudio packages I only
  provide one.

  - glibc-git

    Removed all non-UTF-8 charmaps.  By simplifying the locale-gen script I
    can provide an empty /etc/locales directory for users to add their locales
    as empty files with the name of the locale, e.g. /etc/locales/en_GB

  - pulseaudio-git

    Disables practically every additional feature from dbus to esound support
    leaving only the main POSIX functionality
