Differences from Arch Linux

  While Arch Linux provides mostly complete packages I don't split packages
  into multiple variations.  E.g. Instead of six pulseaudio packages I only
  provide one.

  - glibc-git

    Removed all non-UTF-8 charmaps.  By simplifying the locale-gen script I
    can provide an empty /etc/locales directory for users to add their locales
    as empty files with the name of the locale, e.g. /etc/locales/en_GB

    If the file is not empty then the content can be used as the charmap.

  - pulseaudio-git

    Disables practically every additional feature from dbus to esound support
    leaving only the main POSIX functionality.  This doesn't include a lib32
    libpulse which is problematic when using wine.

  - vim-git

    Built without gtk while still including x11 support with all available
    dynamic interpreters.  Does not include downstream modification such as
    archlinux.vim or change global vimrc locations.

  - xterm-git

    Include a patch which enables keyboard selection based on a search pattern.
    This is a continuation of the work by fmang[1] and pbrisbin[2].
